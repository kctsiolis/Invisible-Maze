# Invisible Maze

This project, which I worked on with Diego Lopez and Shi Qi Zhou, was the winning project at hack_mcwics 2020. The Invisible Maze is a game where the user must navigate a maze using only feedback from a controller via vibrations. The controller emits different vibration patterns depending on whether the user is moving in free space, hitting a wall, or arriving at the end of the maze. 

We were inspired to make this game as a statement to emphasize the importance of accessibility in both game development and software design in general.
